In this project, the goal is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on  the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset). 

The purpose is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set (pml-training.csv). You may use any of the other variables to predict with. You should create a report describing how you built your model, how you used cross validation, what you think the expected out of sample error is, and why you made the choices you did. You will also use your prediction model to predict 20 different test cases. You should also apply your machine learning algorithm to the 20 test cases available in the test dataset (pml-testing.csv).
