1. The dataset has 2,075,259 rows and 9 columns. 
2. We will only be using data from the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02. 
3. The overall goal here is to examine how household energy usage varies over Feb 1st and 2nd, 2007. The task is to reconstruct the given plots, all of which were constructed using the base plotting system.
4. Construct each plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.
5. Name each of the plot files as plot1.png, plot2.png, etc. **Output**: ![plot1.png](https://github.com/shngli/R-data-analysis/blob/master/Household%20power%20consumption/plot1.png), ![plot2.png](https://github.com/shngli/R-data-analysis/blob/master/Household%20power%20consumption/plot2.png), ![plot3.png](https://github.com/shngli/R-data-analysis/blob/master/Household%20power%20consumption/plot3.png), ![plot4.png](https://github.com/shngli/R-data-analysis/blob/master/Household%20power%20consumption/plot4.png)
