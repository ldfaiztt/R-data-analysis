Take the mtcars data set in R and answer the questions using regression models and exploratory data analyses:

1. Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG (miles per gallon) performance
2. Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions

**Output**: 
- Boxplot of MPG comparison between Automatic and Manual transmissions ![boxplot.png](https://github.com/shngli/R-data-analysis/blob/master/mtcars%20multiregressions/boxplot.png)
- Pair graphs displaying the relationships between every variable, colored by transmission type (red = Manual, blue = Automatic) ![pairsgraph.png](https://github.com/shngli/R-data-analysis/blob/master/mtcars%20multiregressions/pairsgraph.png)
- Residual plot of the final multivariate model ![residuals.png](https://github.com/shngli/R-data-analysis/blob/master/mtcars%20multiregressions/residuals.png)
